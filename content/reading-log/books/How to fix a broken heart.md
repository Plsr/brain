* A heartbreak hurts, badly.
* Heartbreak will trigger the same reaction as physical pain would in our
  brain (also: bad physical pain, described as "unbearable", like touching a hot
oven plate).
* Do not search the reasons for the breakup in yourself if there is nothing you
  did wrong.
* Don't get hung up on negative thoughts. Mindful meditation can help with that.
* Don't idealize your ex partner!
