I use Things to keep track of all my todos. If something needs to be done, it will be in Things. 

I picked some parts of [[Getting Things Done (GTD)]] that I implement in my workflow, which Things works well with:
- Everything is captured in an inbox; the inbox is cleared regularly
- Bigger tasks are organized in Projects, with a clear next action
- Projects are reviewed on a regular basis
