> Over the years, I collected a bunch of notes in many different places. They are scattered in varying states of complacency and importance. I'm currently in the process of reviewing everything and collecting it on this site (see [migration process](https://plrs-second-brain.netlify.app/#migration-process) below.

## What topics are in here?

Pretty much everything. I started this as a repository of quick notes of learning I had while programming. A while ago, I stumbled over [Nikita's wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) and decided to go all in. Since then, this is a place for pretty much everything I learned, independent from its general area.
