## What topics are in here?

Pretty much everything. I started this as a repository of quick notes of learning I had while programming. A while ago, I stumbled over [Nikita's wiki](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) and decided to go all in. Since then, this is a place for pretty much everything I learned, independent from its general area.
