When an arguer combines two positions, one easy to defend and the other one
controversial and much harder to defend. When challenged on their position, they

B: Thereâ€™s no evidence showing homeopathy is effective.  
A: Actually there are many ways for people to be healthy besides taking doctor-prescribed drugs. (motte)
